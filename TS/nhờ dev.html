   UPDATE
 </p>
 <p style="margin: 0px;">
   <b>March 2023:</b> the 44-day trial and 90-day trial were ended. However, Shopify still runs promotions from time to time, and you can always <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/ORJMYn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>visit Shopify's Free Trial page</b></a> to check for the latest offer.
 </p>
</div>

<h3>Is it normal if I see a trial shorter than 14 days being offered?</h3>

If you see a free trial shorter than 14 days, don’t panic since <b>it can actually be a good thing.</b> The Shopify team loves to test different offers, and when they do so, you may find a 3-day or 7-day Shopify trial. But it often comes with a bonus to compensate for the shorter period. For example, <b>you may be eligible for a much lower price on select plans after signing up,</b> which is even better than the default 14-day free trial.

## How does the Shopify free trial work?

After signing up for a Shopify free trial, you’ll get 14 days (by default) to play around with your demo store. You will be able to set up your Shopify store and test some basic features; however, you need to choose a paid plan before you can start selling products or services.

You won't lose any of the work you did on your store during the trial if you decide to go with a premium plan. <b>You won't be charged any costs until your free trial ends </b>, even when picking a plan while still in the middle of the trial.

If you do not subscribe to a monthly plan, your store will be suspended at the end of the free trial, and you don’t need to do anything to cancel your Shopify account. The good news is that you will not be charged for anything, but keep in mind that you won’t be able to continue working on your store until you purchase a paid plan.

<b>In short:</b> Signing up for a Shopify free trial <b>costs you nothing</b> unless you decide to go with a paid plan, and it allows you to set up your store, test Shopify features, and decide whether Shopify is right for you.

## How long is the Shopify free trial in 2023?

In the past, the default Shopify free trial was always 14 days. No more.

However, the Shopify trial period can be extended depending on your country, your selected partner, and, most importantly, Shopify promotions.

There are some special occasions when the trial period can last up to 44, 60, or 90 days (for example, during the COVID-19 pandemic). If you want to know more about the different lengths of the Shopify Free Trial, just scroll down to continue reading.


## Shopify 14-Day Trial 

### Overview

<a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/KeAyqy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">![how to get Shopify 14-day Trial](https://cdn4.avada.io/media/shopify/dSDXSEX.jpg)</a>

The 14-day trial is considered the standard Shopify trial. You will get access to the fundamental Shopify features to evaluate the platform before subscribing to a paid plan. You can also install thousands of useful apps from the Shopify App Store to unlock your store’s capabilities.

There’s <b>no credit card required to sign up</b> for the 14-day Shopify trial. Simply enter your email address, store name, and password to begin. Don’t worry if you haven’t chosen a perfect store name yet since you can always change your store name and domain later.

In November 2022, <b>the 14-day trial was replaced with the 3-day free trial + $1/month paid trial.</b> There's no sign that Shopify will bring back the 14-day free trial soon. But if you weigh the two offers thoroughly, you'll find that the 3-day trial is much much better. You only pay $3 to sell with Shopify for your first 90 days, with access to everything included in a paid subscription plan. Meanwhile, <b>although the 14-day trial is free, it does have some limitations on what you can do.</b>

</a>
</p>


### What happens after 14 days (2 weeks) of free trial on Shopify?
 
So here’s what happens after the Shopify free trial: if you haven’t chosen a premium plan yet, your store will be paused by Shopify. But you can always continue your work by subscribing to a monthly plan. There are four options:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/shopify-lite" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shopify Starter (used to be Shopify Lite):</a> selling products on your current website or social media sites and pay as little as $5 per month</li>
<li><a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/shopify-pricing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Basic Shopify plan</a> costs $39 per month in addition to a 2.9% + 30¢ USD transaction fee (for credit card)</li>
<li><a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/shopify-pricing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shopify</a> has a monthly fee of $105, in addition to the credit card rate of 2.6% + 30¢ USD</li>
<li><a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/shopify-pricing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Advanced Shopify plan</a> costs $399 monthly and 2.4% + 30¢ USD credit card rate per online transaction</li>
</ul>
 
Shopify also offers an enterprise plan called <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/gbVPL5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shopify Plus</a>, which begins at around $2000 per month.


## Shopify 21-Day Trial

The 21-day Shopify trial was offered a long time ago. There’s no point in searching the web for this trial version as Shopify has stopped providing it ever since. 


## Shopify 30-Day Free Trial 

In the past, new merchants would get a 30-day trial immediately after signing up for a Shopify account. But back in 2019, Shopify removed this one-month free trial and replaced it with the 14-day trial.

However, sometimes Shopify may run promotions that give you access to a longer trial. You can do a quick check by visiting their free trial landing page.

</button>
</a>
</p>

## Shopify 44-Day Trial 

You may have heard about a 44-day Shopify free trial, but let me tell you what it really is. It’s not an actual trial; however, you can indeed try Shopify free for 44 days by combining the default 14-day trial with Shopify’s 30-day refund policy.

The thing is, currently, there’s no such refund policy since Shopify updated their terms of service a long time ago.

Then, there comes a special promotion that lets people try Shopify free for 14 days and pay only 1$ for the first month, which, in total, is still 44 days. Unfortunately, in July 2022, Shopify stopped this promotion.

But you can always use <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/VyeRrM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>this link</b></a> to check if there are any special promotions at the moment.

<a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/n13jO9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">![how to get Shopify 44 Day Free Trial ](https://cdn4.avada.io/media/shopify/ENyMEHJ.jpg)</a>


## Shopify 60-Day Free Trial 

Back in 2019, Shopify launched a comprehensive marketing campaign, during which it offered free trials of varying lengths via a group of select partners. These partners then shared the exclusive deal with their customers, so it’s not publicly available. The 60-day Shopify trial was a product of that campaign.

In 2023, the 60-day (2-month) Shopify free trial is no longer available. Or maybe it’s still there, but only accessible to a specific group of customers.

Wait, <b>what about the 90-day Shopify free trial?</b> Anyway, 90 days is still better than 60 days, right? Well, let’s see.


## Shopify 90-Day Free Trial

As a part of Shopify COVID-19 Response, the Shopify 90-day trial was launched not long after the initial outbreak of the pandemic.

During the height of COVID-19, many brick-and-mortar businesses struggled a lot, and moving to the online space became a must for them. That’s why the 90-day Shopify free trial was extremely well accepted at that time.

However, on June 1st, 2020, Shopify stopped the 90-day free trial and returned to the standard 14-day trial. So you can’t get it anymore in 2023.

But that doesn’t mean you can’t try Shopify for 90 days in 2023. Starting from 9th November 2022, Shopify is running a special offer that allows you to try the platform free for <b>3 days + 3 months for just $3.</b> This means you’ll have <b>3 + 90 = 93 days</b> to try Shopify, and instead of paying <b>$117 for 3 months</b> of Shopify Basic, you only need to pay <b>$3!</b>

To sign up for this special offer, you can use <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/rn7G7Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration:none"><b> the custom landing page Shopify made for AVADA's audience.</b></a> You'll also get a free gift from us delivered to your email after finishing the signup process.

<div class="cta-box">

## How to extend my Shopify free trial?

### Sign up for an extended Shopify trial

There’s not much you can do to extend your Shopify free trial - unless you’ve signed up with an extended trial in the first place. However, this kind of offer is usually not public and is only available for a very limited time. It’s not there all year round. Shopify promotions come and go, you know.

 <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/rn3ek5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>Click here to check for the latest offer from Shopify.</b></a>

### Work with a Shopify Development Partner to get an “unlimited free trial”

<a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/doAK3Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">![how to get a 30, 60, 90 day free shopify trial](https://cdn4.avada.io/media/shopify/E1qOkbQ.png)</a>

The second way to get a Shopify free trial extension is by joining up with a Shopify Development Partner. These partners can help you set up your store in the <b>“development mode”</b>, allowing you to try out as many different features, themes, and applications as you like before really launching your store.

Well, you can say that it’s an <b>“unlimited Shopify free trial”</b>. But is it really “free”? They say “there's no such thing as a free lunch”, you know.

And, of course, this <b>does not come without a cost</b>. You can test as long as you like until you’re pleased with the platform - no need to pay a Shopify subscription. But to use the partner’s services, you have to pay them. And it’s usually not cheap at all.

So, if you want to <b>extend the Shopify free trial</b> in an economical way, this is definitely not the solution.

### Reach out to Shopify’s support team

Shopify may give you an extended free trial so long as you provide a compelling reason for them to do so. You will need to <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/15LoER" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>contact Shopify's customer support team</b></a>, give them the URL of your store, and explain why you wish to extend your Shopify free trial period.


## How to get the most out of your free trial

<b>Let’s face it:</b> there’s not much you can do to control the length of your Shopify trial period. So, instead of relentlessly searching for the most extended trial, let's switch our focus to <b>how to get the most out of your Shopify free trial.</b>

Here is a checklist to get you started:

- Try adding a few products (or services) and product descriptions to your online store. Make sure that they appear accordingly to the way you want
- Create product categories (collections) to help your customers find them more easily
- Set up <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/n1M2Jx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>Shopify Payments</b></a> and check whether Shopify supports the payment method you want to use
- Learn how to arrange taxes, shipping, and other sales channels by becoming familiar with the Settings page in your Shopify account's Admin section.
- Make sure to visit the <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/doB7jQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>Shopify Theme Store</b></a> and the <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/7mPJk3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>Shopify App Store.</b></a> These stores are where you can find thousands of apps and themes that will help you with every step of your Shopify journey.
- If you own a brick-and-mortar store, remember to download <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/qnM2qn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>Shopify's POS app</b></a> to discover the features and capabilities offered by the various app configurations

You can also visit the <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/ORqmJG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>Shopify learning center</b></a> to access high-quality free training resources from proven experts.

<b>And the last thing to remember:</b> you won't lose any of the hard work you've put into your store during the trial if you <b>subscribe to a paid plan.</b>

## Shopify Free Trial FAQs

### Is Shopify free to use? Can I sell on Shopify for free? Do you have to pay for Shopify?

Shopify is not a free or freemium platform. However, by <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/4eDK5Z" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>signing up for the Shopify Free Trial,</b></a> you’ll get access to almost all of the essential features. During the free trial, you can start selling on Shopify for free. You only need to pay for Shopify when the free trial ends.

### How much is a Shopify account?

You can <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/x93b95" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>create your Shopify account for free.</b></a> However, as we have stated above, you will need to choose a subscription plan to start selling. If you just started your online business, the <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/AoVao1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>Shopify free trial</b></a> is where you should begin.

### Do I need to enter a Shopify discount code to start my free trial?

You don’t need to enter any Shopify code to start your free trial. All you need to do is <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/Zd14d1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>click this link,</b></a> enter your email, password and store name, and that’s it. You can always change your store name later if you don’t like it.

### When does the Shopify free trial start?

Your Shopify free trial starts from the moment you first sign up, not when you begin working on your store.

### Can I sell on my Shopify trial? Can you make money with Shopify free trial?

Of course, you can sell and make money on your Shopify free trial. But you have to choose a paid plan first. Don’t worry; you won’t be charged until the free trial ends. A little reminder: to make money with Shopify, you need to set up your store properly first and then get customers to buy your products. <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/2rqYrO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>Click here to start your free trial and begin selling.</b></a>

### How much is Shopify after the free trial? Does Shopify charge after the free trial ends?

When the trial ends, you must subscribe to a paid plan to continue working on your store. Here are the pricing plans after Shopify free trial:

- <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/shopify-lite" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>Shopify Starter</b></a> — $5 per month

If you don’t purchase a paid plan after the free trial, your store will be deactivated, and Shopify won’t charge you anything.
