Dear Squarespace Affiliate Team,

I’m from Avada Group, an authority on ecommerce services with over 200,000 valuable monthly organic visitors. I believe there’s a strong synergy between our content and Canva’s offerings, making your affiliate program an ideal fit for us both.

Our audience trusts us to recommend only the best tools, and Squarespace’s reputation for excellence is undisputed. I’m confident that promoting Canva will not only add value for my readers but also translate into meaningful conversions and growth for your brand.

I’m excited about the prospect of collaborating and am eager to discuss how we can work together towards shared success.

I tried applying for your campaign via Impact.com but it kept saying my account did not meet the application criteria and was auto-rejected.

Can you please explain me why, and how can we collaborate? 

Hope to hear from you soon, thank you.

Best regards,
Roger
