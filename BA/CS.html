Dear Pyroca,

I hope this message finds you well.
My name is Daniel, and I am the CEO of the AOV Cart Drawer application.

I am writing to inform you that we have recently updated the font size within your store's cart drawer to enhance clarity and improve the overall user experience. We made this adjustment with the intention of making the cart interface more accessible and visually appealing.

I would greatly appreciate hearing your thoughts on the current design of the cart drawer. Your feedback is highly valuable to us as we continue striving to deliver the best possible experience.

Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions, concerns, or further customization requests regarding the cart drawer. I remain at your full disposal.

Wishing you a pleasant and productive day.

Warm regards,
Daniel
CEO, AOV Cart Drawer
